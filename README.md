## Factors Influencing Antler Size in Mature Male White-tailed-Deer
### I wanted to see what features influence of antler size of mature (4.5- and 5.5-year-old) male white-tailed deer.
* Data: This is a unique dataset from a captive colony of white-tailed deer with known age, antler mass (kg), and maternal / paternal parentage.
* Each male was fed ab libitum one of two kinds of pelleted feed that differed in digestible energy, but had similar protein percentage (16%) from the time they were weaned. The standard energy diet 'S' had 2.65 kcal/g of dietary energy and the low energy diet 'L' had 1.77 kcal/g of dietary energy.
* As expected, body mass (bm.kg) was predictive of antler size in mature males. This makes sense because individuals with larger bodies have larger skeletons meaning that more skeletal minerals can be directed towards antler growth. Interestlingly, effects from the mother ('DID') were more influential than the effects from dietary energy on antler size of mature males.
