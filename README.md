# Predictors of Antler Size in Mature (4.5 & 5.5 years) White-tailed-Deer
## I wanted to see what features are most influential of antler size of mature male white-tailed deer.
* Data: This is a unique dataset from a captive colony of white-tailed deer with known age, antler mass (kg), and maternal / paternal parentage.
** Each male was fed ab libitum one of two kinds of pelleted feed that differed in digestible energy, but had similar protein percentage (16%) from the time they were weaned. The standard energy diet 'S' had 2.65 kcal/g of dietary energy and the low energy diet 'L' had 1.77 kcal/g of dietary energy.
* Interestingly, effects from the mother ('DID') were more influential than the effects from dietary energy on antler size of mature males.
