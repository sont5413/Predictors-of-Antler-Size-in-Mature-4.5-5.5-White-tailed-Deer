## Features that Influence Antler Size in Mature Male White-tailed-Deer
### I wanted to see what features influence antler size of mature (4.5- and 5.5-year-old) male white-tailed deer.
* Data: This is a unique dataset from a captive colony of white-tailed deer with known age, antler mass (kg), and maternal / paternal parentage.
* Each male was fed ab libitum one of two kinds of pelleted feed that differed in digestible energy, but had similar protein percentage (16%) from the time they were weaned. The standard energy diet 'S' had 2.65 kcal/g of dietary energy and the low energy diet 'L' had 1.77 kcal/g of dietary energy.
## Findings

### A. 4.5-year-olds:
#### Birth weight of the male was the most important feature in predicting antler size of 4.5-year-old males.  This is surprising that birth weight is ranked higher than the body mass of the individual male.  Interestingly, the effects from the father and mother are also influential, whether it be from their genetics, nutritional condition, or otherwise.  What's most surprising here is that, when it comes to determing antler size of mature males, it didn't really matter whether males had been eating a low or high energy diet throughout their life.

### B. 5.5-year-olds: 
#### Interestingly, the most important feature was SID, which is the father of the male.  Thus, the effects from the father, likely genetic, was the most important feature in predicting antler size of mature males.

### C. Commonalities and differences
#### Birth weight of the male was the most influential feature among 4.5-year-olds and the second most influential of 5.5 year olds.  It is important to note that for both age groups, it wasn't very influential whether or not males were eating a high energy diet versus a low energy diet (as indicated by the feature 'Energy').  In fact, 'Energy' was less predictive than effects from birth weight, body mass, and effects from the mother and father.
